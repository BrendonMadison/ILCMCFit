# ILCMCFit
Includes various files on analyzing Guinea Pig simulation data to characterize beamstrahlung, analyzing ILCSOFT dimuon data to characterize ISR and sqrt(s), and then a Monte-Carlo (MC) fitting program that uses the previous fits and analysis to fit for sqrt(s) in a way that allows us to back out the energy spread and contributions from beamstrahlung and ISR.
